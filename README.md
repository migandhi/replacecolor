Advanced Image Color Replacer

A powerful, client-side web application that allows you to select a color from an image and replace it with precision. Choose your new color from a picker, manual HEX/RGB input, or even by sampling from a second "palette" image.

âœ¨ Key Features

    Precise Color Selection: Click anywhere on your main image to select the exact color you want to replace.

    Flexible Color Picking: Choose your replacement color using:

        A visual color picker.

        Manual HEX or RGB code input.

        A color sampler by uploading a second "palette" image.

    Tolerance Slider: Control the range of replacement. A low tolerance changes only very similar shades, while a high tolerance replaces a broader spectrum of related colors.

    Live Color Preview: Hover your mouse over the main image to see a live preview of the color, including its HEX and RGB values.

    Client-Side Processing: All image processing happens directly in your browser. Your images are never uploaded to a server, ensuring 100% privacy.

    Undo Functionality: Made a change you don't like? Easily revert to the previous step.

    Download as PNG: Save your edited image in high-quality PNG format with a transparent background if the original had one.

    Fully Responsive: The user interface is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

ðŸš€ How to Use the Tool

Follow these simple steps to edit your image:
Step 1: Upload Your Main Image

    Click the "1. Upload Main Image" button and select the image file you want to edit from your device.

Step 2: Select the Color to Replace

    Move your mouse over the uploaded image. The cursor will act as a color selector.

    Click on the specific color within the image that you wish to change.

    The selected color will appear in the "2. Color to Replace" box, showing its swatch, HEX, and RGB codes.

Step 3: Choose Your New Color

You have two options for choosing the replacement color:

    Option A: Picker & Manual (Default Tab)

        Use the visual color picker, or

        Type the desired HEX or RGB values directly into the input fields.

    Option B: From Image

        Click the "From Image" tab.

        Click "Upload Palette Image" and select a second image that contains the color you want to use.

        Click on the desired color within the palette image. The selected color will appear in the "Selected Palette Color" box and will automatically become your new color.

Step 4: Set the Tolerance

    Adjust the "4. Set Tolerance (%)" slider.

    A lower percentage (e.g., 5%) will only replace pixels that are very close to your selected color.

    A higher percentage (e.g., 50%) will replace a much wider range of similar shades and tones.

Step 5: Replace, Undo, and Download

    Click the green "5. Replace Color" button to apply the change.

    If you're not happy with the result, click the "Undo" button.

    Once you are satisfied, click the "Download" button to save your final image as a PNG file.
